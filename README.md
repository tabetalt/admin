## Quickstart

**IMPORTANT:** Our new platform is currently only available as closed beta. Check our
[documentation][docs] for more information and signing up! Backoffice is still under
active development and we don't offer support for it at this time.

_**Note:** We will be adding a quickstart guide as soon we release it for
open beta_

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome, please read [our guide][contributing] to
get started! Check the [developer quickstart][dev-start] to

The Backoffice is built using React, [@tabetalt/kit][kit], Apollo
and Theme UI.
